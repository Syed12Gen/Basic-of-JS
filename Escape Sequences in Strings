// SOLVE THIS:
You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. 
You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.
Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine

myStr should only contain characters shown in the instructions
const myStr = ""; // Change this line

// SOLUTION IS BELOW THIS LINE:
const myStr =  "FirstLine\n\t\\Secondline\nThirdline" ;
