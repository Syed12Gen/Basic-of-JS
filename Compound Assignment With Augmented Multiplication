// SOLVE THIS:
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.
a should equal 25.
b should equal 36.
c should equal 46.
You should use the *= operator for each variable.
You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;


// SOLUTION IS HERE:
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
