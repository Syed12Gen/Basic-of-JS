// SOLVE THIS:
Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator. 
Be sure to include a space between the two strings.
const myStr = "";

// SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE:
const myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."; 
console.log(myStr);

/* The string This is the start. This is the end. would be displayed in the console. */
