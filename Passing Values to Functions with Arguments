// SOLVE THIS
Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
Call the function with two numbers as arguments.
functionWithArgs should output 3


// SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE:
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. 
When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. 
The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

function functionWithArgs(a, b){
  console.log(a + b);
}
functionWithArgs(1, 2);
