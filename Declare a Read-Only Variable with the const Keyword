// Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const.
Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant.
Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.

// Solve this:
var fCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
var fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(fCC, fact); // Change this line

// Solution below this line:
const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line
