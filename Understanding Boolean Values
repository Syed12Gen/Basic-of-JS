// SOLVE THIS

Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.

function welcomeToBooleans() {
  // Only change code below this line

  return false; // Change this line

  // Only change code above this line
}

// SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE:
/* Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. 
They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. 
These two states are mutually exclusive.
Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript. */

function welcomeToBooleans() {

    return true; 

}
