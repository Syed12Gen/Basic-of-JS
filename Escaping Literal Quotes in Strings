// SOLVE THIS:
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
You should use two double quotes (") and four escaped double quotes (\").
Variable myStr should contain the string: I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
const myStr = ""; // Change this line



// SOLUTION IS HERE BELOW THIS LINE:
const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; 
console.log(myStr);
