// Solve this code:
Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:
1-3 - Low
4-6 - Mid
7-9 - High

Note: You will need to have a case statement for each number in the range.


function sequentialSizes(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line



  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

sequentialSizes(1);



// Solution below this line:
function sequentialSizes(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
    answer = "Low"
    break;
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
    answer = "Mid"
    break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
    answer = "High"
  }



  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

console.log(sequentialSizes(1));
console.log(sequentialSizes(2));
console.log(sequentialSizes(3));
console.log(sequentialSizes(4));
console.log(sequentialSizes(5));
console.log(sequentialSizes(6));
console.log(sequentialSizes(7));
console.log(sequentialSizes(8));
console.log(sequentialSizes(9));


// Output 
Low
Low
Low
Mid
Mid
Mid
High
