// SOLVE THIS:
Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order)
const myArray = [];

// SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE:
Reason: With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.
You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket,
end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const myArray = ["String", 1];
console.log(myArray);
