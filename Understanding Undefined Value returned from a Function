// SOLVE THIS:
Create a function addFive without any arguments. 
This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.

// Setup
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

// Only change code below this line


// Only change code above this line

addThree();
addFive();


// SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE:
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. 
In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement,
when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

function addFive(){
sum += 5;
}

console.log(addThree());
console.log(addFive());
