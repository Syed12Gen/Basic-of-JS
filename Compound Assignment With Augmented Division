// SOLVE THIS:
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.
a should equal 4.
b should equal 27.
c should equal 3.
You should use the /= operator for each variable.
You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;

// SOLUTION IS BELOW THIS LINE:
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /=  12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
