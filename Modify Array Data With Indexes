// SOLVE THIS:
Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
// Setup
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];

// SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE:
/* Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const. */

const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
myArray[0] = 45;
console.log(myArray);
